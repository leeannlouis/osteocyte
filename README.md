# osteocyte
This directory includes functions and scripts for analysis of image data of bone cells. 

Images come from thin slices cut from bones, fluorescently labeled with a red dye, and then imaged using a microscope. The code was written for Zeiss-branded microscopes, which produce files in the .czi format. These files can be read using the [Bio-Formats open software](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/).

The database looks like this:
